The advent of genomic data has revolutionised the field of phylogenetic inference by recovering novel hypotheses of evolutionary relationships supported by massive datasets across diverse organisms. Many of the new clades revealed in phylogenomic studies of land plants have led to revised classification schemes and macroevolutionary hypotheses. While the widespread availability of genomic data has improved our understanding of land plant evolution, a significant portion of the diversity in the studied groups has been overlooked, as these molecular-based studies excluded extinct taxa.

The inclusion of fossils in phylogenetic inferences often results in new clades, the recognition of novel synapomorphies, and revised macroevolutionary scenarios. Thus, the phylogenetic relationships among major land plant lineages remain far from satisfactorily resolved. This project aims to lay the groundwork for phylogenetic and macroevolutionary studies in bryophytes (non-vascular plants with monosporangiate sporophytes) and early polysporangiophytes (Palaeozoic plants with multisporangiate sporophytes), taking into account:

(a) the diversity of both fossil and extant species (in the case of bryophytes),

(b) the entirety of available evidence.

These taxa are significant both for their phylogenetic position and their morpho-anatomical traits. Bryophytes, on one hand, are the sister group to vascular plants and are characterised by a gametophyte-dominated life cycle and the absence of vascular tissues. Early polysporangiophytes, meanwhile, represent an artificial group considered "morphological intermediates" between bryophytes and vascular plants, distinguished by their multisporangiate sporophytes.

To ensure a taxonomically representative sampling of both groups throughout their biostratigraphic ranges, this initial phase will focus on Palaeozoic taxa. Although much of the work involves revisiting existing collections, the relatively low number of described specimens in the country (particularly fossil bryophytes) necessitates new field campaigns in the Tres Cóndores Formation (La Rioja) and the Agua Colorada Formation (Catamarca).

Newly discovered fossil material, along with existing specimens in collections, will be studied using previously underutilised techniques (e.g., SEM, epifluorescence microscopy) to:

(i) propose primary homology hypotheses for morphological characters observed across different taxa,

(ii) construct morphological matrices for phylogenetic analyses in combination with other data types.

The results will shed light on new phylogenetic relationships among these taxa and evaluate alternative macroevolutionary scenarios in the early history of land plants.

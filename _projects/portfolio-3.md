Hypotheses of homology are fundamental for understanding the phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary trajectories of land plants. However, the emergence of major lineages is marked not only by clear morphological innovations (e.g., cuticles, seeds) but also by ambiguous features with unresolved homologies (e.g., seed coats). This project aims to clarify homology hypotheses using a dynamic homology approach across three key clades: embryophytes, bryophytes, and angiosperms.

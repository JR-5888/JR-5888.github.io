Hypotheses of homology are fundamental in order to understand the phylogenetic relationships of land plants and their evolutionary trajectories. However, the emergence of major lineages are marked not just by morphological novelties (e.g., cuticules or seeds) but also are hindered by morphological features whose homologies are unclear (e.g., seed coats). In this project, the aim is to clarify homology hypotheses through a "dynamic homology" approach in three major clades: embryophytes, bryophytes and angiosperms.
